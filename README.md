# LTZ1000-Reference-Board
## Bare-bones LTZ1000 carrier PCB
In my experience, I've found that some things work best when you just leave them alone. I guess the same thing applies for precision voltage references - the less you bother them, the better. Just let them do their thing. This board was designed in that spirit - no weird thermal cutouts, no bizzaire crop circles (okay, maybe just one).

The overall form factor and layout of this board was inspired by the reference board from the HP3458A 8.5 digit multimeter, while the (3D-printed) plastic cap comes from both the 3458A and Keithely 2002 8.5 digit multimeter. If it was good enough for them, it's good enough for me.
